I also Need to check the permissions.
There are several types of permissions.

Authentication has an enable disable with user and admin passphrases.
This toggle enables User and Admin accounts.
If its disabled then all access is guest.

After that there is action permissions.
Delete, Flag, Archive.
This is based on those permission levels.
If its set to guest then any user can do it.
If its set to a higher level, you need to be logged in at that level or higher to do the action.

Then there is the toggle permissions.

Content Scan, Content Lock, Hide Archive, Safe Mode.

Each of theses has a user level, as well as a passphrase.

If the current user meets or beats the required level then the user can toggle.
If they dont meet the level then the passphrase is prompted.

So even if autentication is disabled, and all users are guest.
If the content scan is set to admin, then the guest user will be asked for the passphrase.

I want to give all of them passphrases.  So that they can be toggled by anyone.

I also want to add a permission for settings access. Also with a passphrase.
The icon should always appear, but prompt for the passphrase if the user is not logged in at the required level.

###Settings Access
Settings Access [Group Level] [Passphrase] 

###Authentication
Enable Authentication

User Passphrase
Admin Passphrase

###Action Permissions

Delete Files [Group Level] [Passphrase]
Flag / Unflag Files [Group Level] [Passphrase]
Archive / Unarchive Files [Group Level] [Passphrase]

###Toggle Permissions

Content Scan [Group Level] [Passphrase]
Content Lock [Group Level] [Passphrase]
Hide Archive [Group Level] [Passphrase]
Safe Mode [Group Level] [Passphrase]

Passphrase is not required.
If the passphrase does not exist, and the user does not meet the required level then the toggle will not work.
If the passphrase does not exist, and the user meets the required level then the toggle will work.
If the passphrase exists, and the user does not meet the required level then the toggle will prompt for the passphrase.
If the passphrase exists, and the user meets the required level then the toggle will work.
